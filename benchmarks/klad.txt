Writing Parquet Files:
We'll explore how Pandas and Polars handle the task of writing data to Parquet files, a common format for data storage.
Parquet files are widely used for their columnar storage, which can significantly impact memory consumption.

Reading Parquet Files:
We'll investigate how both libraries perform when reading Parquet files.
Efficiency in data ingestion is crucial, and we'll measure and compare memory usage for this task.

Filtering Dataset/DataFrame:
Filtering data is a common operation in data processing.
We'll evaluate how Pandas and Polars handle filtering tasks and assess their memory efficiency during this process.

Joining (Left, Inner, Outer):
Joining datasets is often a memory-intensive operation.
We will explore how memory usage varies when performing left, inner, and outer joins with both libraries.

Grouping with Aggregating:
Aggregating data is essential for generating insights from large datasets.
We'll compare how Pandas and Polars handle grouping and aggregation operations, taking memory efficiency into account.
