**Title**: Pandas vs. Polars: Memory Usage

There is a significance of efficient data processing, especially when it comes to managing memory usage. 
Effective memory management can significantly impact the performance and scalability of data processing tasks ...
Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/about/index.html) has long been used by data professionals ... Pandas (Python for Data Analysis) is a Python library designed for data analysis. The primary features of the library revolve around its exposure of a Dataframe-centric way of working. Moreover, critical code paths are written in C or Cython to enhance performance. Pandas provides the capability to read and write data from a wide range of sources and formats, spanning from CSV to Excel. Once data is stored in a dataframe, Pandas offers extensive functionality for common data manipulations, such as reshaping, joining, slicing, and more.
Python with pandas is in use in a wide variety of academic and commercial domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics, Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more.


However, ... polars is a recently developed open source ... Polars (https://www.pola.rs/) boasts about their speeds compared to Pandas, claiming to be much faster. 
On top of that, Polars is built upon the safe Arrow2 implementation of the Apache Arrow specification (https://arrow.apache.org/), enabling efficient resource use and processing performance. 
By doing so, it also integrates seamlessly with other tools in the Arrow ecosystem.
All in all, its embarrassingly parallel execution, cache efficient algorithms and expressive API makes it perfect for efficient data wrangling, data pipelines, snappy APIs and so much more.

Both libraries offer similar functionality through slightly different APIs, but their implementation differs due to the choice of programming language.
The fact that Polars is written in Rust inherently gives it an advantage over Pandas, which is primarily written in Python with core components in C or Cython. 
Rust is known for its speed and superior memory management compared to C.

In this blog post, we run some benchmarks on our local machine and reflect on the performance of pandas and polars in terms of memory usage. 
Rather than focusing on execution time, the focus of our blog post predominantly lies in comparing memory usage as a function of time.
Our aim is to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how these libraries manage memory during these fundamental data processing tasks.
What does it mean for practitioners?
...

Writing Parquet Files:
We'll explore how Pandas and Polars handle the task of writing data to Parquet files, a common format for data storage.
Parquet files are widely used for their columnar storage, which can significantly impact memory consumption.

Reading Parquet Files:
We'll investigate how both libraries perform when reading Parquet files.
Efficiency in data ingestion is crucial, and we'll measure and compare memory usage for this task.

Filtering Dataset/DataFrame:
Filtering data is a common operation in data processing.
We'll evaluate how Pandas and Polars handle filtering tasks and assess their memory efficiency during this process.

Joining (Left, Inner, Outer):
Joining datasets is often a memory-intensive operation.
We will explore how memory usage varies when performing left, inner, and outer joins with both libraries.

Grouping with Aggregating:
Aggregating data is essential for generating insights from large datasets.
We'll compare how Pandas and Polars handle grouping and aggregation operations, taking memory efficiency into account.
